-- Create the 'owners' table
CREATE TABLE owners (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    device_ip VARCHAR(50),
    location VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the 'events' table
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_id INT NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    data_payload JSON,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

Explanation:
- owners Table:- Stores information about the owner, including their name, phone number, email, device IP, and location.
- Uses id as the primary key.

- events Table:- Logs events (leaks, usage, or quality data) with details such as the event type, status, and a JSON payload (data_payload).
- Includes a timestamp column to track when the event occurred.
- The owner_id column establishes a foreign key relationship with the owners table, ensuring events are associated with an owner.
